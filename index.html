                        <div>iOS app - In 2019, the Apple Developer Academies were invited to create solutions for the
                            Gulmakai Champions, the network of leaders of social programs from The Malala Fund. We ran a
                            great ideation process, close to representatives
                            from the Malala Fund and Apple. At the end, we came with 4 different ideas to help the
                            Champions in their daily work. One of this ideas is Moniba. The name comes from Malala's
                            best friend, who was there for her since the beginning
                            of her story as activist.<br><br> This app's goal is to help the Champions to share their
                            activities among their network, showing what they are doing and what kind of help they need.
                            Moniba is more than a virtual assistant,
                            she is a friend! This app is not available at the open App Store. It is only available to
                            the Champions. In this project, I act as PO and main developer. Contributing also with
                            developing the app and the server.<br><br> If

                            responsibility of the speech therapist to seek and identify children with deficits in the
                            development of communication early. This is
                            considered one of the great markers and early indicators of the child's global development.
                            <br><br> The early identification of speech-language disorders combined with guidance to
                            family members and caregivers significantly increases the chances of a good prognosis.
                            Although there are specific research and evaluation
                            instruments for the language area, standardized scales and screening and evaluation
                            instruments have proved to be useful and necessary tools, which can contribute to referrals
                            for diagnosis. In this scenario, a good screening

                        <p>ComPaixão is a virtual prayer schedule for your dear friends and relatives, it has daily
                            reminders to assist you in organizing your prayers. Besides, his big difference is that he
                            calls you to action, his biggest invitation is that you do something in favor of that
                            prayer, if for example, I can give God a job opportunity for my sister, what could I do to
                            help her? I could help her improve Linkedin, talk to friends who work in her sector or even
                            help her create new networks. This was the first big project with Swift that I did, I used
                            technologies like: UIKit, CoreData e Figma.</p>

                        <p>It is almost a tradition of the Biblical University Alliances to have moments of leisure and
                            fun in the midst of so much academic difficulty, to have a moment to make new friends and
                            even meet people from other courses and universities. It is in this scenario that it is
                            necessary for participants to have a place to know, remember and subscribe to enjoy such
                            unique moments! I remember when I arrived at the university and I didn't know anyone and it
                            was basically a new unknown universe and it was during a camp that I was so welcomed and
                            helped by so many good people. In this project I had the pleasure of developing the entire
                            designer using the prototyping tool Figma.</p>

                            speaks what should happen in the next days of the program bringing words of comfort and
                            consolation in the midst of Crisis and reminding them that there is a God who takes care of
                            us at all times. In this project I had the honor of working as a Designer using Figma as a

                        <p>At the beginning of the pandemic we left without leaving home and living our common life,
                            until one day the batteries of our television remote control run out of charge! Because of
                            that, every moment I needed to touch the television and I was working, I had to find where
                            my cell phone was, open an app and wait 5 years for it to load and then I could use it, not
                            to mention how to see advertisements every time I hit "Enter". Thinking about solving this
                            problem of mine I went to find technologies that could accomplish this task… Then one day I
                            found a library in Javascript that communicated with a TV, then run here, run there, go in
                            design, run to implement all the buttons and reimplement as routes in TypeScript and
                            incorporate ElectronJS to compile for all platforms and Uhuuuuu, my problems with remote
                            controls are over!</p>

                <p>Apart from being a mobile developer, I spend most of my time testing new designs, I like to train
                    with real applications that help people. During the semesters of graduating from diverti helping to
                    create systems to help study groups and
                    university campings.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0">In my free time, I take the opportunity to stay with the family and make the most of the
                    time with each of them. This quarantine period has been a new way of living and enjoying the moments
                    with them, as much as it is a little more busy
                    than it was, I learned another way to live and enjoy life with them.
